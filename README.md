Migration bioreactor-ui to vite &amp; pnpm &amp; ts

I am creating a template for UI, updating the packages and develop a GH Actions using pnpm to:

- Build every push and pull request in master branch
- Build GH Page
- Made a semantic versioning in master, alpha and beta branchs.
- Set --frozen-lockfile to improve GH Actions with pnpm.

## Next steps

- Migrate UI from original repo.
  - Update old/deprecated packages.
  - Migrate to TS every component.
